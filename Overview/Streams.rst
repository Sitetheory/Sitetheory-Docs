Overview
========

Streams are pages that list all of the content that share similar tags. When Articles, Profiles, Events, or other content are associated with a tag, that content will appear on Stream pages that are associated with those tags. Streams come in many different layouts to fit different needs, e.g. a landing page with a big slideshow and other dynamic modules below, a blog style page with images and words flowing down the page, a grid of photos, or a simple compact text list, etc.
