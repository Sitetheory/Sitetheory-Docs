Overview
========

Streams are a Content Type that displays content associated with specific tags. Streams come in many different layouts to fit different needs, e.g. a landing page with a big slideshow and other dynamic modules below, a blog style page with images and words flowing down the page, a grid of photos, or a simple compact text list, etc.

Streams are technically just another content type like Article, since they are essentially just a page on the website with a URL. But since they have a very specific functionality to display other content types (rather than being content themselves), it makes more sense to separate them in the normal workflow of creating content. So in the admin they exist in a separate section and when we fetch all content we generally exclude Streams (and other unique content like Menu).
