Overview
########

Aside from handling regular website page requests, Sitetheory also handles all API requests through the /Api url on any
domain. Sitetheory is a RESTful API using the standard methods of (GET, PUT, POST, DELETE, etc) for interaction with all
entities and standard actions for viewing, creating, editing, and deleting content. Everything is accessible through the
API. Access is controlled through a robust permissions system, with granular role or user based access to
assets (site, bundles, content type, specific records or even fields). Additional SOAP style requests are available in
the API for advanced filtering.
