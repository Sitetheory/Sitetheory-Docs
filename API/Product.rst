Overview
========

The Product entity is a *routable* Content Type (i.e. "page"). This API lets you fetch all Product content specifically (without other types of content mixed in), which is useful in many cases where you only want products. It inherits all the standard functionality and features of a Content entity. See Content API for more details :doc:`/1.0/API/Content`.
