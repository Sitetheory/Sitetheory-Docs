Overview
========

The Profile entity is a *routable* Content Type (i.e. "page"). This API lets you fetch all Profile content specifically (not other types of content). It inherits all the standard functionality and features of a Content entity and normally we would use the Content API for fetching all content or specific content based on ID. See Content API for more details :doc:`/1.0/API/Content`.
