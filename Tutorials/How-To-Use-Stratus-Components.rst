How to Use Stratus Components
#############################

You can add a lot of really powerful Stratus components to your HTML to add functionality to your design. Components can be UI functionality intended for Editing in the admin (e.g. Theme Selector) or for the public websites like (e.g. Carousel for slideshows). Other components are built to be logic on the page (e.g. Lazy Loading which loads the right size image for the container, only when it's needed).

See our :doc:`Stratus-Components documentation </1.0/Overview/Stratus-Components>` for available components and how to use them.
